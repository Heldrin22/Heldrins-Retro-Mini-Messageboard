# OdinProject_Mini_Message_Board

12/22/24
Changed the board to use PostgreSQL for its message database.

An interactive message board webapp project for The Odin Project, using EJS and Express.

Styling of the "case" and "screen" is based on retro computers of the late 70's and 80's. Much of the inspiration comes from the Apple II. The animations for the screen flicker and scanlines are thanks to the "Fallout Terminal Inspired CSS Theme" on Codepen by Mack Richardson, and "Creating a Fallout-Style UI Using Modern CSS" on Codemotion by Massimo Avvisati.

I have plans to add sound and update so that the on/off button will turn the screen on and off with animation, as I learn to implement JS better.
